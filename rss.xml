            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Let It All In</h1><p>We are told that we live in the age of experience.  That we value what we do more than what we have.  That we value what we see more than what we take.  But how much do we really let in?  How much experience are we really open to?  In a time where everything must be recorded or in some other form captured digitally, have we not simply replaced packaged goods with digital files?  This is not to challenge the digital life (of which I am obviously partaking) but to ask if we're really getting better at how and what we experience.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/9a0ff4acf64dcc160ea68de74facb42dc9a2bf7c.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>You Get Out What You Put In</h1><p>This phrase typically precedes a notion of effort's impact on what one wishes to accomplish.  Push more, get more.  Work better, be better.  We'd be better served if we chose to pivot, to place greater perspective on divergence—that is to say different in, different out.  By putting more variety into our lives and work, we are more likely to create and be something materially more interesting and impactful.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/8b5da8ec65a5b4bc72634f49065c89ddd90d6b5e.jpg"></article>]]></description>
