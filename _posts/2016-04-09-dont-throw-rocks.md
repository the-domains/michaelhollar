We are told not to throw rocks.  We all live in glass houses.  Lifting the offensive stone is a sure way to invite a counterattack that cannot be fended off.  We are told it's better to keep our mouth shut and thoughts to ourselves.  But what if we shared our observations not to hurt but to understand, and welcomed the response not to brace but to better, ourselves?

Dr. Jeremy Sherman, an evolutionary epistemologist, believes we should throw two stones, one at that of our friend and one at our own.  His position is that through searching for our own "weaker windows" we can find opportunities for self-improvement while reducing the appearance of condescension.[][0]

By openly discussing our observations of and with another, we gain the opportunity to see another in a way that we otherwise might not see; to know them in a way we would otherwise not know.  By processing the underpinnings of our own frailties and how they relate to those of others, we uncover not only self-improvement opportunities but also more deeply appreciate our relationship with those around us.
