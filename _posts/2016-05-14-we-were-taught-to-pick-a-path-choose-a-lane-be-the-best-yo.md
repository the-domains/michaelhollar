We were taught to pick a path, choose a lane; be the best you can be at something...anything. Get into something comfortable, keep your head down, and accrue your well-deserved vacation time. This is oh so singular. There is no thing we can do that another can't do cheaper or better, others including the chips and memory spinning up in the cloud.

Nathanial Hawthorne said "Every individual has a place to fill in the world and is important in some respect whether he chooses to be so or not."

If we are to choose our place, to find our path, we must acknowledge that that path is not straight or all beautiful and leaf or rose pedal-covered. There is brush and ravines, possibly desert and cacti. It is everything but comfortable. And as we emerge from our trek, scarred and grinning, we will come to realize that we are good at many things, passionate about more, a perfect manifestation of ourselves. Singularity cannot touch us.
