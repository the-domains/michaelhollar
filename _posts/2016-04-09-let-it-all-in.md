Let it all in.  

We are told that we live in the age of experience.  That we value what we do more than what we have.  That we value what we see more than what we take.  But how much do we really let in?  How much experience are we really open to?  In a time where everything must be recorded or in some other form captured digitally, have we not simply replaced packaged goods with digital files?  This is not to challenge the digital life (of which I am obviously partaking) but to ask if we're really getting better at how and what we experience.

The Dalai Lama often recommends a particular form of Buddhist meditation called analytic meditation.  It utilizes reasoning to process emotion.  

By thinking about what we feel we can better process and take on adversity, turn seemingly negative responses into positive outcomes.  By allowing ourselves to feel what we think about, we can more present and self-aware in day-to-day activities and ultimately, more human.
